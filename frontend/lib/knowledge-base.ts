## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is an AI employee?**
A: An AI employee is a digital worker that performs business tasks such as marketing, support, admin, lead generation, and more — all powered by AI and configured for your workflows.

**Q: How does StaffPilot work?**
A: You choose a role (or roles), we configure your AI employee, you plug it into your business, and it works 24/7. Depending on your plan, you can manage it yourself or have a human expert manage and optimise it for you.

**Q: Can an AI employee replace a human?**
A: In many roles, yes. AI employees can perform faster, more consistently, and at a dramatically lower cost — especially for repeatable, process-driven work.

**Q: Is it hard to set up?**
A: No. Self-Setup includes templates and best practices, and Managed/Dedicated plans include human experts who handle setup, optimisation, and ongoing improvements for you.


**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Absolutely. We use industry-standard encryption, follow modern security best practices, and can work with your compliance needs (GDPR/CCPA-style requirements, NDAs, etc.).

**Q: Can the AI assistants be trained on my company's specific data?**
A: Yes! All plans include training on your business processes. Enterprise plans include advanced custom training on proprietary data.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Yes, plans are generally month-to-month with no long-term contracts. You can downgrade or cancel with reasonable notice depending on your agreement.

**Q: How is this different from using ChatGPT or other AI tools directly?**
A: StaffPilot gives you pre-configured AI employees, role-specific workflows, and (on higher tiers) human management — so you’re not writing prompts or building systems yourself. It’s closer to hiring a trained team member than buying a raw AI tool.
